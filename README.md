# My dotfiles for Artix with i3
These are the config files that I created.

# Requirements

```
i3
polybar
picom-ibhagwan
i3lock-fancy
feh
```
## Yay install command
`yay -S i3 polybar picom-ibhagen i3lock-fancy-git feh`

# Guide
Simply move the **.config** folder into your users **home**.
Then move your preferred background to ~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpeg.
Also for best results install the paper GTK theme and use rofi-select-theme.
